    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we'll learn about a new measure of model fit called the coefficient of determination or _r-squared_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make several models and compute the goodness of fit values\n",
    "- Learn how to interpret r-squared\n",
    "- Explore the effect of outliers on model fit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus:**\n",
    "- Explore the relationship between model complexity and goodness of fit\n",
    "- Read through the case study on confounding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starter code\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the [starter code](./code/starter-code/W3-Lab2.2-Starter.ipynb) as soon as you are ready.\n",

    "> [Solution Code](./code/solution-code/W3-Lab2.2-Solutions.ipynb)\n",

    "#### Deliverable\n",
    "\n",
    "* A completed Jupyter notebook\n",
